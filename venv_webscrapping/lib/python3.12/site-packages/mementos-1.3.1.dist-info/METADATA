A quick way to make Python classes automatically memoize (a.k.a. cache) their
instances based on the arguments with which they are instantiated (i.e. args to
their ``__init__``).

It's a simple way to avoid repetitively creating expensive-to-create objects,
and to make sure objects that have a natural 'identity' are created only once.
If you want to be fancy, ``mementos`` implements the `Multiton
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiton_pattern>`_ software pattern.

Usage
=====

Say you have a class ``Thing`` that requires expensive computation to create, or
that should be created only once. Easy peasy::

    from mementos import mementos

    class Thing(mementos):

        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name

        ...

Then ``Thing`` objects will be memoized::

    t1 = Thing("one")
    t2 = Thing("one")
    assert t1 is t2    # same instantiation args => same object


Under the Hood
==============

When you define a class ``class Thing(mementos)``, it looks like you're
subclassing the ``mementos`` class. Not really. ``mementos`` is a metaclass,
not a superclass. The full expression is equivalent to ``class
Thing(with_metaclass(MementoMetaclass, object))``, where ``with_metaclass`` and
``MementoMetaclass`` are also provided by the ``mementos`` module. 

Metaclasses are not normal superclasses; instead they define how a class is
constructed. In effect, they define the mysterious ``__new__`` method that most
classes don't bother defining. In this case, ``mementos`` says in effect, "hey,
look in the cache for this object before you create another one."

If you like, you can use the longer invocation with the full ``with_metaclass``
spec, but it's not necessary unless you define your own memoizing functions.
More on that below.

Python 2 vs. Python 3
=====================

Python 2 and 3 have different forms for specifying metaclasses.
In Python 2::

    from mementos import MementoMetaclass

    class Thing(object):

        __metaclass__ = MementoMetaclass  # now I'm memoized!

        ...

Whereas Python 3 uses::

    class Thing3(object, metaclass=MementoMetaclass):

        ...

``mementos`` supports either of these. But Python 2 and Python 3 don't
recognize each other's syntax for metaclass specification, so straightforward
code for one won't even compile for the other. The ``with_metaclass()``
function shown above is the way to go for cross-version compatibility. It's
very similar to that found in the ``six`` cross-version compatibility module.

Careful with Call Signatures
============================

``MementoMetaclass`` caches on call signature, which can vary greatly in Python,
even for logically identical calls. This is especially true if kwargs are used.
E.g. ``def func(a, b=2): pass`` can be called ``func(1)``, ``func(1, 2)``,
``func(a=1)``, ``func(1, b=2)``, or ``func(a=2, b=2)``. All of these resolve to
the same logical call--and this is just for two parameters! If there is more
than one keyword, they can be arbitrarily ordered, creating *many* logically
identical permutations.

So if you instantiate an object once, then again with a logically identical call
but using a different calling structure/signature, the object won't be created
and cached just once--it will be created and cached multiple times.::

    o1 = Thing("lovely")
    o2 = Thing(name="lovely")
    assert o1 is not o2     # because the call signature is different

This may degrade performance, and can also create errors, if you're counting on
``mementos`` to create just one object. So don't do that. Use a consistent
calling style, and it won't be a problem.

In most cases, this isn't an issue, because objects tend to be instantiated with
a limited number of parameters, and you can take care that you instantiate them
with parallel call signatures. Since this works 99% of the time and has a simple
implementation, it's worth the price of this inelegance.

Partial Signatures
==================

If you want only part of the initialization-time call signature (i.e. arguments
to ``__init__``) to define an object's identity/cache key, there are two
approaches. One is to use ``MementoMetaclass`` and design ``__init__`` without
superfluous attributes, then create one or more secondary methods to add/set
useful-but-not-essential data. E.g.::

    class OtherThing(with_metaclass(MementoMetaclass, object)):

        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name
            self.color = None   # unset for now
            self.weight = None

        def set(self, color=None, weight=None):
            self.color = color or self.color
            self.weight = weight or self.weight
            return self

    ot1 = OtherThing("one").set(color='blue')
    ot2 = OtherThing("one").set(weight='light')
    assert ot1 is ot2
    assert ot1.color == ot2.color == 'blue'
    assert ot1.weight == ot2.weight == 'light'

Or you can just define your own memoizing metaclass, using the factory function
described below.

Visiting the Factory
====================

The first iteration of ``mementos`` defined a single metaclass. It's since been
reimplemented as a parameterized meta-metaclass. Cool, huh? That basically means
that it defines a function, ``memento_factory()`` that, given a metaclass name
and a function defining how cache keys are constructed, returns a corresponding
metaclass. ``MementoMetaclass`` is the only metaclass that the module
pre-defines, but it's easy to define your own memoizing metaclass.::

    from mementos import memento_factory, with_metaclass

    IdTracker = memento_factory('IdTracker',
                                lambda cls, args, kwargs: (cls, id(args[0])) )

    class MyTracker(with_metaclass(IdTracker, object)):
        ...

        # object identity is the object id of first argument to __init__
        # (and there must be one, else the args[0] reference => IndexError)

The first argument to ``memento_factory()`` is the name of the metaclass being
defined. The second is a callable (e.g. lambda expression or function object)
that takes three arguments: a class object, an argument ``list``, and a keyword
arg ``dict``. Note that there is no ``*`` or ``**`` magic--args passed to the
key function have already been resolved into basic data structures.

The callable must return a globally-unique, hashable key for an object. This key
will be stored in the ``_memento_cache``, which is a simple ``dict``.

When various arguments are used as the cache key/object identity, you may use a
``tuple`` that includes the class and arguments you want to key off of. This can
also help debugging, should you need to examine the ``_memento_cache`` cache
directly. But in cases like the ``IdTracker`` above, it's not mandatory that you
keep extra information around. The raw ``id(args[0])`` integer value would
suffice, as would a constructed string or other immutable, hashable value.

In cases where arguments are very flexible, or involve flexible data types,
a high-powered hashing function such as that provided by
`SuperHash <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/SuperHash>`_ might come in handy.
E.g.::

    from superhash import superhash

    SuperHashMeta = memento_factory('SuperHashMeta',
                                lambda cls, args, kwargs: (cls, superhash(args)) )

For the 1% edge-cases where multiple call variations must be
conclusively resolved to a unique canonical signature, that can be done on a
custom basis (based on the specific args). Or in Python 2.7 and 3.x, the
``inspect`` module's ``getcallargs()`` function can be used to create a generic
"call fingerprint" that can be used as a key. (See the tests for example code.)

Notes
=====

* See ``CHANGES.rst`` for the extended Change Log.

* ``mementos`` is not to be confused with `memento
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/memento>`_, which does something completely
  different.

* ``mementos`` was originally derived from `an ActiveState recipe
  <http://code.activestate.com/recipes/286132-memento-design-pattern-in-python/>`_
  by Valentino Volonghi. While the current implementation quite different and
  the scope much broader, the availability of that recipe was what enabled
  this module and the growing list of modules that depend on it. This is what
  open source evolution is all about. Thank you, Valentino!

* It is safe to memoize multiple classes at the same time. They will all be
  stored in the same cache, but their class is a part of the cache key, so the
  values are distinct.

* This implementation is *not* thread-safe, in and of itself. If you're in a
  multi-threaded environment, consider wrapping object instantiation in a
  lock.

* Automated multi-version testing managed with `pytest
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest>`_, `pytest-cov
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-cov>`_,
  `coverage <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage/4.0b1>`_
  and `tox
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox>`_. Continuous integration testing
  with `Travis-CI <https://travis-ci.org/jonathaneunice/mementos>`_.
  Packaging linting with `pyroma <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyroma>`_.

* The author, `Jonathan Eunice <mailto:jonathan.eunice@gmail.com>`_
  or `@jeunice on Twitter <http://twitter.com/jeunice>`_ welcomes
  your comments and suggestions.

Installation
============

To install or upgrade to the latest version::

    pip install -U mementos

You may need to prefix these with ``sudo`` to authorize
installation. In environments without super-user privileges, you may want to
use ``pip``'s ``--user`` option, to install only for a single user, rather
than system-wide. Depending on your system configuration, you may also
need to use separate ``pip2`` and ``pip3`` programs to install for Python 
2 and 3 respectively. As a fall-back for cases where the releationship between
``pip`` and the Python interpreter you want to run is unclear, you can
invoke ``pip`` as a module under a specific Python executable::

    python3.6 -m pip install -U mementos

Testing
=======

To run the module tests, use one of these commands::

    tox                # normal run - speed optimized
    tox -e py27        # run for a specific version only (e.g. py27, py34)
    tox -c toxcov.ini  # run full coverage tests
